About this project
This project is a very simple demonstration of a potential use case of Large Language Models (LLMs) in ministry. The KJV Chatbot, as its name suggests, is a RAG chatbot grounded with text from the King James Bible. 
Instead of the bigger, closed source solutions such as GPT 4 or Claude, this chatbot uses smaller, open-source models, (llama3 and gemma2) in its implementation. The aim here is to enable users with limited computing resources and internet access to run the chatbot locally on their PC.
Disclaimer
This chatbot is very experimental. Outputs and citations may not be 100% accurate, therefore it is not meant for widespread use, but rather as a basis for a broader discussion and a much more refined product that will bring value to Christians and all who are interested in exploring Godï¿½s word.
This chatbot can not and will never be a substitute for the Holy Spirit, who makes all that is hidden and mysterious to be known.
As the Bible is no ordinary document, but God Himself (insert scripture here), there is a huge responsibility on the developer to ensure that the Bible is presented holistically, without any additions or omissions of any kind. (insert Revelation) (insert Luke om stumbling)
Features
Issues:
Long load times due to heavy resource usage by LLMs
Long load and response times in follow up questions, such as 'tell me more'. Models tend to hallucinate despite clear instructions in prompt template. This also includes the references/citations shown at the end of the responses.
