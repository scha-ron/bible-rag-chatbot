# Bible RAG Chatbot

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for answering questions about the Bible, specifically using the King James Version (KJV). The chatbot uses Ollama for language models and Streamlit for the user interface.

## Features

- Question answering based on the King James Version of the Bible
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation for accurate and contextual responses
- Streamlit-based user interface for easy interaction
- Dockerized setup for easy deployment and scalability

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Project Structure

```

├── chatbot.py          # Main Streamlit application
├── preprocess.py       # Script to preprocess Bible text and create vector store
├── config.py           # Configuration settings
├── .env                # Environment variables
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
├── Dockerfile          # Dockerfile for the Python application
└── docker-compose.yml  # Docker Compose configuration
```

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bible-rag-chatbot.git
   cd bible-rag-chatbot
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root and set the `DB_PATH`:
   ```
   DB_PATH=/app/bible_vectorstore
   ```

3. Build and run the Docker containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. Once the containers are running, you need to pull the required Ollama models:
   ```
   docker-compose exec ollama ollama pull llama3
   docker-compose exec ollama ollama pull gemma2
   ```

5. Access the chatbot interface at `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.

## Usage

- Open the Streamlit interface in your web browser.
- Type your Bible-related questions in the chat input.
- The chatbot will provide answers based on the KJV Bible, using RAG for accurate and contextual responses.

## Development

To modify the chatbot or add new features:

1. Make changes to the Python files as needed.
2. Rebuild and restart the Docker containers:
   ```
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with Ollama models, ensure they are properly pulled and available in the Ollama container.
- Check Docker logs for any error messages:
  ```
  docker-compose logs
  ```
